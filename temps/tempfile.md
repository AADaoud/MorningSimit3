Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been hospitalized after his 2020 rape conviction in New York was overturned, according to his lawyer, Arthur Aidala. Weinstein was moved to a Manhattan hospital on Friday and remains in jail after being separately convicted of rape in Los Angeles. Aidala described his client's health as "somewhat of a train wreck" and stated that Weinstein needs a lot of physical help due to his numerous health problems. The New York City Department of Correction determined that Weinstein required immediate medical attention, leading to his transfer to the hospital. Weinstein is currently being kept for observation at Bellevue Hospital, according to a spokesperson from the corrections department.

Weinstein's lawyers have previously stated that he has experienced a series of health issues, including diabetes, sleep apnea, and problems with his heart and eyes. In 2020, he spent five days in the hospital due to ongoing heart problems and chest pains. Aidala is scheduled to meet with Weinstein on Monday before his court appearance on Wednesday.

Earlier in the week, the New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's conviction, citing that he did not receive a fair trial. The court stated that prosecutors in the #MeToo case called witnesses whose accusations were not part of the charges against him, resulting in an unfair trial. As a result, a new trial has been ordered. In his 2020 trial, Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. In a separate case in California, Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years for raping an Italian model and actress in 2013.

The overturning of Weinstein's conviction has been met with mixed reactions. Some view it as a betrayal and a profoundly unjust decision, while others see it as a necessary step to ensure a fair trial. The #MeToo movement, which was sparked by Weinstein's initial conviction, remains defiant in the face of this development.
